"Start a Job Journal, noting positive and negative comments from supervisors and managers. Keep notes from meetings, schedule changes, etc. Make sure you note when, where, why, etc. Save company memos and pay stubs, ANYTHING that you think will help your case if you must use a government agency to fight the boss." - [IWW](https://www.iww.org/organize)

All your notes should have the date at the top of each page, and next to any notable action or important statement, jot down the time if possible. Dated and timed statements are more difficult to argue against than vague recollections.

Your bosses keep notes on you. If your notes can be more detailed and specific, you can counter their false claims and possibly cause them to improve their behavior if they know their workers are keeping track of them. If possible, copy your notes regularly and keep a copy off of the worksite so you can maintain access to them at any time.

You can use [this free PDF template](https://www.iww.org/PDF/Organize/JobJournal.pdf) to print and keep an organized journal of things that happen in the workplace.
