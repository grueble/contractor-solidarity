Working class people across the world are organizing and mobilizing to support each other at the sites of the workplace, housing, and beyond to deal with this new health crisis. When the ruling class fails to take care of us, we will find ways to take care of each other, and organize for even better labor and living conditions. [This article](https://itsgoingdown.org/autonomous-groups-are-mobilizing-mutual-aid-initiatives-to-combat-the-coronavirus/) features mostly US-based local initiatives and programs to alleviate the effects of the pandemic and its various impacts on workers.
