        Facebook just has this internal culture of ‘We treat our employees so well; everyone is so happy’, and I think that’s relatively true for full time employees. But there’s this massive other part of the workplace that you don’t engage with that much, and it’s really different for them.

        The exclusion of TVCs from important communications and fair treatment is part of a system of institutional racism, sexism, and discrimination. TVCs are disproportionately people from marginalized groups who are treated as less deserving of compensation, opportunities, workplace protections, and respect.

        Once you recognise the imbalance inherent in the company-contractor relationship, the story these companies tell to justify their use of contractors starts to fall apart.

        This deliberate sleight demonstrates the caste-like system deployed by Google, which fails to protect its workers and our colleagues. For a company that likes to innovate, it’s striking to see such a lack of vision for treating all of their workforce with basic dignity.

        I believe that H-1B employees tend to tolerate more bullshit from managers because they cannot move to another company that easily, and they cannot just rage-quit. This is possibly the key reason why managers like H-1Bs — lower turnover rate and employees who will take more shit.

        The use of subcontractors makes it hard to hold the primary business legally responsible when workers are hurt on the job or wages go unpaid. Through subcontracting, companies like Twitter avoid the cost of keeping workers’ bodies healthy and able to work with health insurance and safe workplaces.

        Very suddenly in May, nine RAs were fired without warning. When asked for the reason, the management told them that they had violated a company policy. There was just one problem — the policy in question didn’t exist.
